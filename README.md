# Brain clock: Code for the analyses performed in the study "A machine-learning approach identifies rejuvenating interventions in the human brain"

Scripts used for preprocessing the transcriptomics data we used to train the transcriptomic brain clock underlying our platform for detection of brain-rejuvenating interventions, `brainAgeShiftR`, and for training and testing the model and to perform the analyses depicted into the study. The scripts within the scripts directory is divided into the following modules:
1. Preprocessing (`scripts/preprocessing`).
2. Model training (`scripts/model_training`).
3. Model testing (`scripts/model_testing`).
4. Mice analyses (`scripts/mice_analyses`).
5. Functional enrichment (`scripts/func_enrich`).
